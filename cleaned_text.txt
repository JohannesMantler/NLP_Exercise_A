when i was a little girl i used to read fairy tales in fairy tales you meet prince charming and hes everything you ever wanted in fairy tales the bad guy is very easy to spot the bad guy is always wearing a black cape so you always know who he is then you grow up and you realize that prince charming is not as easy to find as you thought you realize the bad guy is not wearing a black cape and hes not easy to spot hes really funny and he makes you laugh and he has perfect hair i suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and thats it i’ve learned that you can’t predict love or plan for it for someone like me who is obsessed with organization and planning i love the idea that love is the one exception to that love is the one wild card in high school i used to think it was like sooooo cool if a guy had an awesome car now none of that matters these days i look for character and honesty and trust i write songs about my adventures and misadventures most of which concern love love is a tricky business but if it wasnt i wouldnt be so enthralled with it lately ive come to a wonderful realization that makes me even more fascinated by it i have no idea what im doing when it comes to love no one does theres no pattern to it except that it happens to all of us of course i cant plan for it i cant predict how itll end up because love is unpredictable and its frustrating and its tragic and its beautiful and even though theres no way to feel like im an expert at it its worth writing songs about more than anything else ive ever experienced in my life i love you like i love sparkles and having the last word and thats real love i write a lot of songs about love and i think that’s because to me love seems like this huge complicated thing but it seems like every once in a while two people get it figured out two people get it right and so i think the rest of us we walk around daydreaming about what that might be like to find that one great love where all of a sudden everything that seemed to be so complicated became simple and everything that used to seem so wrong all of a sudden seemed right because you were with the person who made you feel fearless why leave when you can stay why stay if you have to go if youre horrible to me im going to write a song about it and you wont like it thats how i operate just because as human beings what we cant have is what we reply in our head over and over again before we go to sleep i still love sparkles and grocery shopping and really old cats that are only nice to you half the time i still love writing in my journal and wearing dresses all the time and staring at chandeliers i love these people so much and getting to go out there to look them in the eye and tell them that is my favorite part of the night we should love not fall in love because everything that falls breaks in a relationship each person should support the other they should lift each other up im not opposed to falling in love you need to be happy with yourself or youll never be able to be happy in a relationship
